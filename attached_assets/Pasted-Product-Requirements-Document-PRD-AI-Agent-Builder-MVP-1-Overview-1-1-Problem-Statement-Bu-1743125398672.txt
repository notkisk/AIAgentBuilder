Product Requirements Document (PRD)

AI Agent Builder (MVP)

1. Overview

1.1. Problem Statement

Building AI-driven automation workflows today requires manual setup (e.g., dragging nodes in n8n or writing scripts). Many users want a fully AI-assisted way to create agents without manual configuration.

1.2. Solution

An AI-powered agent creation tool where users describe what they need in natural language, and the system:

Interprets the prompt (e.g., "Create an AI assistant that organizes my emails and sets reminders.")

Selects the right tools/APIs (e.g., Gmail API, Calendar API, LLM processing)

Auto-generates an operational AI agent

(Future) Allows manual editing of nodes in a visual interface

1.3. Target Audience

Non-technical users who want AI-powered automations.

Developers looking to prototype AI agents quickly.

Businesses that need AI agents for workflow automation.

2. Features & Functionalities

2.1. Core Features (MVP)

✅ Natural Language-Based Agent Creation

Users input a prompt like:

"Monitor a website for price changes and notify me on Telegram."

"Summarize my daily emails and store them in Notion."

AI processes the intent and constructs an agent with predefined tools.

✅ Predefined Tools & API Integrations (Similar to n8n, Zapier, LangChain)

Core tools for automation, including:

LLM Processing (GPT, Claude, local models)

Web Scraper (fetch & process data from websites)

Email & Calendar APIs (Google, Outlook, etc.)

Data Processors (summarization, translation, filtering)

Database & Storage (Firebase, PostgreSQL, Vector DBs)

Messaging & Notifications (Telegram, Discord, Slack)

HTTP Requests (to interact with external APIs)

✅ Agent Execution & Logging

Agents can run manually, on a schedule, or based on triggers.

Users can monitor execution logs.

✅ Basic UI for Prompt-Generated Agents

Clean UI with TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI.

Displays:

Agent Name & Functionality

Connected APIs & Tools

Execution Logs

2.2. Future Features (Post-MVP)

🚀 Editable Node-Based UI (like n8n but AI-assisted)
🚀 Multi-Agent Collaboration (Agents communicate & share data)
🚀 Custom Code Blocks for Advanced Users
🚀 Prebuilt AI Agent Templates (e.g., "Social Media Manager", "Research Assistant")
🚀 Marketplace for Sharing & Selling AI Agents

3. UI/UX Design (TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI for a Modern Look)
