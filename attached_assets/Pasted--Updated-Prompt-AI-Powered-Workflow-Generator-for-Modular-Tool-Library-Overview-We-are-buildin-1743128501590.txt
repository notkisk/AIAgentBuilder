🔹 Updated Prompt: AI-Powered Workflow Generator for Modular Tool Library
📝 Overview
We are building a fully modular, node-based automation system that allows users to connect various tools (Slack, Gmail, OpenAI, Web Scraping, etc.) to automate workflows.

🔹 The system should also include an AI-powered workflow generator, which automatically maps out a workflow based on a natural language prompt from the user.

For example:
🗣 User prompt: "When I receive an email from my boss, summarize it and send it to Slack."
🤖 AI-generated workflow:
📩 Read Gmail → ✨ Summarize with ChatGPT → 💬 Send to Slack

🔹 How Replit Should Implement This
1️⃣ Modular Tool System
Each tool should be implemented as a standalone module, exposing essential functions via a universal API format.
✅ Each tool is a self-contained file (tool-gmail.js, tool-slack.js, etc.).
✅ Each tool has defined inputs, outputs, and triggers to connect with others.
✅ Follows a standardized structure to allow dynamic execution.

2️⃣ Node-Based Architecture
The system should be node-based, meaning:
✅ Each tool acts as a node in a workflow graph.
✅ Users can visually connect multiple tools (drag-and-drop UI in the future).
✅ Database stores workflows as JSON objects that define tool connections.
✅ Nodes execute sequentially based on data dependencies.

3️⃣ AI-Powered Workflow Generator
Users will describe their desired automation in plain English, and our AI will:
1️⃣ Analyze the prompt using NLP (OpenAI or Llama 3).
2️⃣ Identify required tools (e.g., Gmail, ChatGPT, Slack).
3️⃣ Map out a workflow (convert text into JSON format).
4️⃣ Generate an executable node graph (ready for automation).

🔹 Example Input & Output:

🗣 User Prompt:
"Every morning, fetch the latest news about AI from Google, summarize it, and send it to my email."

🤖 AI-Generated Workflow:
🌍 Web Scraper (Google Search: AI news) → 🤖 Summarize with ChatGPT → 📩 Send Email

      }
    ]
  }
}
🚀 This allows users to create workflows effortlessly!

🔹 Core Tool Library & Functions
📩 Gmail API Tool (tool-gmail.js)
✅ readEmails(filters): Reads emails based on filters (e.g., unread, from:John Doe).
✅ sendEmail(to, subject, body): Sends an email.
✅ deleteEmail(emailId): Deletes an email.
✅ markAsRead(emailId): Marks an email as read.
✅ extractAttachments(emailId): Gets attachments from an email.

💬 Slack API Tool (tool-slack.js)
✅ sendMessage(channel, message): Sends a message to a Slack channel.
✅ createChannel(name, isPrivate): Creates a new Slack channel.
✅ addUserToChannel(channel, user): Adds a user to a channel.
✅ fetchMessages(channel, limit): Fetches messages from a Slack channel.

🤖 OpenAI GPT Tool (tool-chatgpt.js)
✅ generateResponse(prompt, options): Sends a prompt to GPT and gets a response.
✅ summarizeText(text): Summarizes long text.
✅ extractKeywords(text): Extracts important keywords from text.

📆 Google Calendar API Tool (tool-calendar.js)
✅ createEvent(title, startTime, endTime, attendees): Creates an event.
✅ fetchEvents(dateRange): Fetches events for a specific date range.
✅ deleteEvent(eventId): Deletes an event.
✅ updateEvent(eventId, updates): Updates an event.

🌐 Web Scraping Tool (tool-webscraper.js)
✅ fetchPage(url): Fetches raw HTML content from a page.
✅ extractData(url, selector): Extracts specific data from a page.
✅ screenshotPage(url): Takes a screenshot of a webpage.

🔗 HTTP Request Tool (tool-http.js)
✅ get(url, headers): Makes a GET request.
✅ post(url, data, headers): Makes a POST request.
✅ put(url, data, headers): Makes a PUT request.
✅ delete(url, headers): Makes a DELETE request.

📂 Database Connector (tool-database.js)
✅ query(sql, params): Executes a SQL query.
✅ insert(table, data): Inserts data into a table.
✅ update(table, conditions, updates): Updates records in a table.

🔹 How the Node-Based Workflow Works
✅ Each tool is a node with inputs, outputs, and triggers.
✅ Nodes are connected dynamically, forming a logical automation flow.
✅ User inputs a prompt → AI maps out the workflow automatically.

🔹 Future Expansion
🚀 Phase 1: Implement core toolset & manual workflow creation.
🚀 Phase 2: Build the AI-powered workflow generator.
🚀 Phase 3: Develop a drag-and-drop workflow editor UI.
🚀 Phase 4: Open-source the library & allow community contributions.

🔹 Why This is Game-Changing
✅ No-code workflow automation (like Zapier, but AI-driven).
✅ Scalable & modular (new tools can be added easily).
✅ AI-powered workflow generation (turn prompts into workflows).
✅ Seamless integrations (Slack, Gmail, OpenAI, APIs, DBs, and more).
